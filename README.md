# HttpServer
working on a http server in c++, its called PrinceServer. so far only handles requests but soon will have multithreading to hadnle muliple connections at once.

# Usage

Prince server is unique as it allows <cpp></cpp> tags in the html.

the cpp inside these tags gets compiled and ran on the server

# Note

this is more of a proof of concept thing and not meant to be used in production as their are vunrebilitys in running random c++ on your computer.
